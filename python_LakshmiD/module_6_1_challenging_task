''' the output of given program will be "True"
The current program has three integer values assigned to three variables
in variable d, the RHS is a set of operations that compare the value
a < b > c - 1
substituting the values in variables
2 < 12 > 1-1
applying orders of precedence
2 < 12 > 0
this is true

1 > 0
this is also true

hence the output is a boolean, True'''
